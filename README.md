# Art_auction

This is a Java program simulates an online art auction system. It allows authenticated users to:

- View available artworks
- Add selected artwork to their cart and place orders
- Add new artworks for selling
- Place bids on existing artworks

All artworks are stored and managed using a Binary Search Tree (BST) structure (ArtTree), allowing efficient insertion and search by artwork name. The system includes exception handling to gracefully manage invalid user inputs, especially for numeric fields like login credentials, pricing, and bids.
